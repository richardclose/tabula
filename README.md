# tabula
Uniform access to, and addressing of, tabular data in spreadsheets. CSV, XLS, XLSX.

My use case is a system that receives uploaded data in several different formats. The data may be CSV files, or it may be an Excel workbook containing several tables which are addressed by sheet/row/column or a named range.

## Examples
TBD
